# ENGR101-2017
C++ code for controlling Raspberry Pi 2s in ENGR101 during 2017

This code will be for controlling the diffrent senosrs and motors connected to the RPi to complete the Autonmous Vehicle Challenge for ENGR101. 

Likely this space will also be used to plan the project and keep track of our work.
